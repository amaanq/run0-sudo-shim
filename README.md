`run0-sudo-shim` attempts to imitate sudo as close as possible, while actually using `run0` in the back.

`run0` does not rely on SUID binaries, which makes it a more secure option.
It is also included in any systemd-based linux installation.

However, many programs just expect sudo to exist, so a shim is necessary to make those programs work.

```
Shim for the sudo command that utilizes run0

Usage: sudo [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

          [IGNORED] invalidate timestamp file

  -P, --preserve-groups
